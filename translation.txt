The phrase "hello how are you how are you how are you" in English carries a slightly emphatic or insistent tone due to the repetition.  A direct translation wouldn't capture this nuance perfectly. Here are a few options in Runyankole, each with slightly different connotations:

* **Oire otya? Otya? Otya?** This is a literal translation, repeating "How are you?" three times.  It's grammatically correct but might sound unnatural to a native speaker.

* **Oire otya?  Mbwenu oremeire?** This translates to "How are you? Are you well?" The second part adds a more concerned tone.

* **Oire otya?  Naawe oremeire?**  This is similar to the above but uses "Naawe" which is a slightly more emphatic way of saying "And you?"  Implying a more concerned and inquisitive tone.


* **Oire otya?  Ogumeire?** This translates to "How are you? Are you doing well?"  A more common and natural way to express concern.


The best option depends on the context and desired level of formality. For a general greeting, **Oire otya? Ogumeire?** or **Oire otya?  Mbwenu oremeire?** are likely the most natural-sounding choices.  The repeated "Otya? Otya? Otya?" while grammatically possible, might sound overly insistent and unnatural in conversation.
